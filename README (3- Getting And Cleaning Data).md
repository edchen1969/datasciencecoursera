"Getting And Cleaning Data" Project
README file
---

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. 

This project is to prepare a tidy data set of Human Activity Using Smartphone that can be used for later analysis. The link below is the raw dataset that  represents data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 

A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: 

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

Here are the raw data for the project:

This project contains the following components:

1. **README file**
2. **CodeBook** : It contains description of each variables of the tidy data set.
3. R script called **run_analysis.R**: It consolidates raw data into a tidy data set. 
4. A tidy dataset **human_activity_data_tidy.txt** generated by run_analysis.R. It contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

- The *run_analysis.R* should be place in your local drive. For example: C:\Users\yourname\Documents\R\

- In RStudio: set working directory to the local folder. For example: setwd("C:\\Users\\yourname\\Documents\\R\\UCI HAR Dataset\\"), followed by: source("run_analysis.R")

- The *run_analysis.R* script will check for a **data** folder at the current working directory. The data folder is the place holder for download data files and tidy data file.

- If the zip file is not in the **data** folder, *run_analysis.R* will download, unzip, and delete it.

- The *run_analysis.R* will load data via read.table()

- The *run_analysis.R* will produce a tidy data file called *human_activity_data_tidy.txt* under **./data/UCI HAR Dataset**
